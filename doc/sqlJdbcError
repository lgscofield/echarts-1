org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create JDBC driver of
class 'com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDataSource' for connect URL
'jdbc:sqlserver://192.168.201.18:1433;databaseName=EW-EHR'

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Explanation:
This error has occurred if the sqljdbc4.jar is located in both the
$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib directory and the
$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/$MY_APP/WEB-INF/lib directory.

Solution:
Remove sqljdbc4.jar from the webapps lib directory.  Restart tomcat.  Now,
even if sqljdbc4.jar is present in the webapps lib directory, the error should
not reappear.  Unless tomcat is restart while the files are present in both
directories.
