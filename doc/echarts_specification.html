<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>First of all, this spec is in no way complete.  Comments and suggestions are
welcome.</p>
<p>ECharts is an ERP system for behavioral health care agencies.  It's aimed at
making provider-patient interactions more effective and efficient.  It will accomplish
this through the use of a web interface with common web-type components, such as a
user dashboard, dynamic tabs, and real-time patient search.  The application will
also provide easy access to a scheduler, patient creation/termination forms,
and physician's order sheet. all of which will be described in detail below.</p>
<p>Another goal is to provide an electronic version of the health chart for any
patient in the system.  This makes it easier for providers to view and edit
information for any patient as well as removing some of the complexity of maintaining
a physical chart and the procedure in which the provider would be otherwise involved.</p>
<p>A messaging component will also be part of ECharts.  This will allow any provider to
leave a message on a patient's <acronym title="Electronic Health Record">EHR</acronym>
for any other provider to view.</p>
<p>Since there will be a need to use paper documents created before this application
was implemented, ECharts will facilitate scanning and viewing paper documents.</p>
<p>This spec doesn't make a point of discussing any of the underlying code, but
rather what the user sees when they interact with ECharts.  Specifically, this
document is more concerned with the functionality and the interaction design,
not the exact look and layout.</p>
<h3>Scenarios</h3>
<h4>Scenario #1: Sally - A case manager</h4>

<h3>Non Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do billing</li>
<li>Validate users</li>
</ul>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<h4>First contact &mdash; The Dashboard</h4>
<p>The first thing any user will see is their dashboard.  This is the jump-off
point to any other services the application may offer.  This also means that
each user may not have any tools in common with other users.  However, the things
that will be common is the logo in the upper left of the screen followed by the
strip where dynamic tabs will be opened, followed by the dashboard area where
the provider's tools will be visible.</p>
<p>The screen resolution target is 1024x768.</p>
<p>Here is a simple flowchart of how a user will access the dashboard.</p>
